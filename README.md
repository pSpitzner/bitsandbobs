# Bits and Bobs
This is a collection of little python hacks and workarounds that I use frequently across projects.


# Install

Some dependencies that I recommend installing via conda:
```
conda install numpy matplotlib h5py
```

Our stuff:
```
python -m pip install git+https://github.com/pSpitzner/bitsandbobs
```

[Why not simply `pip install`?](https://adamj.eu/tech/2020/02/25/use-python-m-pip-everywhere/)
